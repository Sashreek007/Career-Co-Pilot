# Feature: Interviews
## Status: Scaffolded

## What's Done
- InterviewsPage with 4 tabs: Questions, Answer Drafts, Mock Simulator, Performance History
- QuestionsTab: grouped by category (technical/behavioral/company), difficulty badges, context notes
- AnswerDraftsTab: STAR format display (situation/task/action/result/reflection)
- MockSimulatorTab: sequential question flow, textarea input, stub scoring feedback
- PerformanceHistoryTab: Recharts LineChart for score history, session details list
